# Other Use Cases

## What Else can MCSManager do?

Now you should have deployed at least one instance, but there is more to discover!

MCSManager can start any Docker image (e.g. `mysql:8`). You can also run any command you want like `cmd.exe` or `bash` directly without Docker, just like an `SSH Client`. 

All in all, you can run **any application** using MCSManager!
