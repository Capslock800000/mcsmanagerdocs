# Running Docker Image

## Selecting Docker Image

You can use any docker images found on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

For example `mysql:8.3.0`，`cm2network/csgo:latest`，`jammsen/palworld-dedicated-server`.

You can also create your own Docker image using a `Dockerfile`.

## Using Docker Image

On the `Instances` page, click the `Create` button. Select `Use Docker Image` and follow the instructions to complete the remaining setup.

::: tip
You don't have to pull the docker image before starting the instance, MCSManager will do it for you if needed.
